This package is reserved for visualization utilities (hiddenlayer, torchviz, matplotlib wrappers).

Launch TensorBoard in the notebook
- Use the magic commands in a Jupyter/Colab cell:
  - `%load_ext tensorboard`
  - `%tensorboard --logdir runs`

This opens an embedded TensorBoard interface right inside your notebook cell.
